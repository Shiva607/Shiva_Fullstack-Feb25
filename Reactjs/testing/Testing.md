## 🧪 Testing Pyramid in React Applications

![Testing Pyramid](https://testsigma.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/testing-pyramid.png)

This image illustrates the **Testing Pyramid**, a common strategy in software testing. It emphasizes writing more **unit tests** than **integration** or **end-to-end (E2E)** tests, to ensure speed, reliability, and maintainability.

## 🧩 Testing Setup with Jest & React Testing Library

### 1. **Jest**

* Jest is a **JavaScript testing framework** for running and organizing tests.
* Commonly used in **React** and **Express** apps.
* Optimized for **speed and simplicity**.
* 📘 Docs: [jestjs.io/docs/configuration](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration)

---

### 2. **React Testing Library**

* Helps test **React components** by simulating how users interact with them.
* Focuses on **behavior** and **user experience**, not internal implementation.
* Bundled with **Create React App** in recent versions.
* To run tests:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

---

### 3. **Snapshot Testing**

* Automatically captures and stores component output in `.snap` files.
* Used to detect UI changes over time.
* ⚠️ If output changes, Jest will flag the test unless the snapshot is updated.

#### Run Snapshot Test

```bash
npm test
```

#### Update Snapshot

Interactive mode: Press `u`
Or run:

```bash
npm test src/components/testing/__test__/MyButton.test.js -- -u
# or
npm test src/components/testing/__test__/MyButton.test.js -- --updateSnapshot
```

---

### 4. **React Test Renderer**

* Converts React components to **JSON** for snapshot comparisons.
* Requires manual installation:

  ```bash
  npm install react-test-renderer
  ```
* ⚠️ Now **deprecated**. Prefer using `@testing-library/react` instead.

---

### 5. **Folder Structure for Tests**

* ✅ Recommended structure:

  ```
  src/
  ├── components/
  │   └── MyButton/
  │       ├── MyButton.js
  │       └── __test__/
  │           └── MyButton.test.js
  └── __test__/ (for global/common tests)
  ```

## **React Testing Library and Testing Methodologies: TDD vs BDD**

### React Testing Library (RTL)

**Overview:**
React Testing Library is a testing utility for React that focuses on testing components in a way that resembles how users interact with them.

**Official Documentation:**

* Introduction: [RTL Intro](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
* Cheatsheet: [RTL Cheatsheet](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet)

**Running a Specific Test File:**

```bash
npm test src/components/testing/__test__/Greeting.test.js
```

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Definition:**
Test-Driven Development is a software development process where you write the tests before writing the actual code. It follows this cycle:

1. **Write a test** for a new function or feature.
2. **Run the test**, which should fail (since the feature isn’t implemented yet).
3. **Write the code** to make the test pass.
4. **Refactor** the code while ensuring the test still passes.

**Benefits:**

* Encourages modular, maintainable code
* Detects errors early
* Drives development with clear objectives

**Reference:** [TDD Guide](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/what-is-test-driven-development)

---

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

**Definition:**
Behavior-Driven Development extends TDD by emphasizing collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders. It focuses on the behavior of an application for the end user.

**Features:**

* Uses natural language syntax to define test scenarios
* Often implemented with tools like Cucumber or Jest with descriptive test cases

**Reference:** [BDD Guide](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/what-is-bdd)

### TDD vs BDD vs ATDD (Acceptance Test-Driven Development)

**Reference Document:** [Comparison Guide](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/tdd-vs-bdd-vs-atdd)

| Approach | Focus               | Participants                   | Test Syntax                        | Primary Tooling                 |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| TDD      | Code correctness    | Developers                     | Technical                          | Unit testing frameworks         |
| BDD      | Behavior            | Developers + QA + Stakeholders | Natural language (Given/When/Then) | Cucumber, Jest (with BDD style) |
| ATDD     | Acceptance criteria | All stakeholders               | Acceptance tests                   | FitNesse, Robot Framework       |
