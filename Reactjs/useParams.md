# **why** we can directly use `useParams()` in this case but **not directly pass `id` as a prop**. 🤔

Let me break it down clearly:

---

### 🌍 **React Router and URL Parameters**

React Router is designed to manage navigation and route handling **based on the URL**.  
When you define a route with parameters (e.g., `/user/:id`), **React Router takes care of capturing the parameter (`id`) from the URL**.

### 🚀 **How `useParams()` Works:**

When you use `useParams()`, it gives you **access to the URL parameters**. These are the **dynamic segments** in your route path that are matched based on the current URL.

For example:
- **URL:** `/user/1`
- **Route Path:** `/user/:id`

In this case, React Router automatically **extracts `id`** from the URL and provides it to your component, which you can then use.

So, in this context, you **don't need to pass `id` manually** as a prop to the component; **React Router injects the value of `id` into your component automatically**.

### 🌟 **Why You Can’t Pass `id` Directly as a Prop:**

React Router doesn’t pass URL parameters like `id` automatically as props to the components. **You have to extract it yourself** using `useParams()`.

Here’s why:
- React Router matches routes based on the URL, and components rendered by routes are not aware of each other's context unless explicitly passed down via props.
- The route components are rendered dynamically, and **React Router uses its internal context** (managed by `BrowserRouter`) to provide the URL parameters.

---

### 📚 **Here’s the Flow:**

1. **URL:** `/user/1`
2. **Route Match:** `/user/:id`
3. **React Router:** Recognizes the `id` part (`1`) from the URL.
4. **useParams()**: Accesses this `id` and returns it as an object: `{ id: "1" }`.
5. **Component:** `UserProfile` can then access the `id` via `const { id } = useParams()`.

---

### ❌ **What Happens If You Pass `id` as Prop?**

If you were to try and **pass `id` manually as a prop** (like this: `<UserProfile id={id} />`), it would **not work** because React Router doesn't automatically pass URL params to components.

For instance:
```jsx
<Route path="/user/:id" element={<UserProfile id={id} />} />
```
This would **not pass the correct `id`** from the URL into `UserProfile`. You must **use `useParams()`** to access the URL parameters.

---

### 🎯 **TL;DR** (Too Long; Didn't Read):
- **useParams()** is the **correct way** to read URL parameters like `id` because React Router automatically makes them available to the component.
- React Router **does not pass URL parameters as props** directly to components.
