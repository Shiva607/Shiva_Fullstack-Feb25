//! output.txt.gz VS output.gz
/*
1. fs.createWriteStream('output.txt.gz')

		* The output file is named output.txt.gz
		* This implies that the file being compressed was a .txt file, and now it is GZipped.
		* This naming convention helps someone understand that the original file was likely a plain text file (e.g., input.txt) and it was compressed.

2. fs.createWriteStream('output.gz')

		* The output file is named output.gz
		* It doesnâ€™t indicate the original file type (e.g., .txt, .json, etc.)
		* Still a valid GZIP file, but the name is more generic.
