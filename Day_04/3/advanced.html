    <h2>CSS Basics</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements on a webpage. It controls aspects like colors,
            fonts, margins, and layouts. CSS helps separate content from design, making web pages more flexible.
        </p>
    </div>
    <section>
        <p>There are three ways to apply CSS: Inline, Internal, and External. Inline applies styles directly to
            elements, while internal is placed inside style tags. External CSS is stored in a separate file and linked
            to HTML for better maintainability.</p>

        <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
        <p>CSS selectors help target HTML elements to apply styles efficiently. Common selectors include element (p),
            class (.box), and ID (#header) selectors. These allow precise styling based on element type or assigned
            attributes.</p>

        <p>Combinators define relationships between elements for more specific styling. The descendant (div p) and child
            (div > p) selectors target nested elements differently. Sibling selectors like adjacent (div + p) and
            general (div ~ p) apply styles to elements that follow another.</p>

        <p>Advanced selectors provide even more control over styling. Attribute selectors (input[type="text"]) target
            elements based on attributes. Pseudo-classes (:hover, :nth-child(n)) allow styling based on user
            interactions and element positions.</p>
