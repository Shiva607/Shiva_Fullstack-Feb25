        <h3>About CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to design and format web pages. It controls the
            layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness of HTML elements. CSS allows for separation of content
            and
            design, making web development more efficient. It supports selectors, classes, and IDs to target specific
            elements. There are three types of CSS: Inline CSS (inside an element), Internal CSS (within &lt;style&gt;
            in
            HTML), and External CSS (linked via a .css file). CSS3 introduced animations, flexbox, grid layouts, and
            media
            queries, enabling modern, responsive web designs across different devices and screen sizes.</p>
