        <h3>About JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a powerful scripting language used to add interactivity, dynamic behavior, and functionality to
            web
            pages. It allows developers to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle events, validate forms, and create
            animations.
            JavaScript runs on the client side, making web pages responsive without needing constant server requests. It
            supports modern features like ES6+, asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await), and APIs for web
            development. JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js simplify development. It is
            essential for building interactive websites, web applications, and even backend services using Node.js,
            making
            it one of the most widely used programming languages today.</p>
